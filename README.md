[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomwanzek/d3-ng2-demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomwanzek/d3-ng2-demo)

## Purpose

The running web app can be seen at: [d3-ng2-demo Github Page](https://tomwanzek.github.io/d3-ng2-demo/).

It illustrates the use of a _D3 Service_ as a provider for the rendering of **D3** data visualizations implemented as Angular 2 components.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.11-webpack.8.
